    "2. those sampled were not representative of the voting population, e.g., some said that there was an overrepresentation of college graduates in some poll samples \n",

    "+ Question 6: We will carry out a study of the sampling error when there is no bias. In other words, we will try to compute the chance that we get the election result wrong even if we collect our sample in a manner that is completely correct. In this case, any failure of our prediction is due entirely to random chance.\n",
    "+ Question 7: We will carry out a study of the sampling error when there is bias of the second type from the list above. In other words, we will try to compute the chance that we get the election result wrong if we have a small systematic bias.
