In this exercise you will use the `hist` function in `matplotlib` instead of the corresponding `Table` method to draw histograms.\n",

    "#### Question 5b) ####\n",
    "In Data 8 you studied the Supreme Court case of [Swain versus the State of Alabama](https://www.inferentialthinking.com/chapters/11/1/Assessing_Models.html), where a question before the Court was whether a jury panel of size 100 had been selected at random from a population in which 26% of the people were black. That was the percent of black people in the population that was eligible to serve on the panel.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use `np.random.multinomial` to simulate drawing at random with replacement from a categorical distribution. The arguments are the sample size `n` and an array `pvals` of the proportions in all the categories. The function simulates `n` independent random draws from the distribution and returns the observed counts in all the categories. Read the documentation to see how this is described formally; we will use the formal terminology and notation in future assignments after we have discussed them in class.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will see that the function also takes a third argument `size`, which for our purposes will be an integer that specifies the number of times to run the entire simulation. All the runs are independent of each other. \n",
    "\n",
    "Write one line of code that uses `np.random.multinomial` to run 10 independent simulations of drawing 100 times at random with replacement from a population in which 26% of the people are black. The output should be an array containing the counts in the black category in the 10 simulations. It will help to recall how to slice `NumPy` arrays. Assign your answer to the variable `sample`.\n",
